## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

- The Bun/TypeScript engine remains authoritative; native clients do not read or mutate workspace YAML.
- The MVP transport is authenticated loopback HTTP/JSON plus replayable SSE.
- Linux is the primary deliverable; macOS is a thin architectural proof that must be built and verified on macOS hardware or CI.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 105 requires an early spike against the exact pinned libghostty and Zig versions.
- Phase 107 requires access to a macOS CI runner or physical macOS host; Linux-only inspection cannot complete MAC-06.

## Deferred Items

See REQUIREMENTS.md Out of Scope for deferred product breadth and platform polish.
